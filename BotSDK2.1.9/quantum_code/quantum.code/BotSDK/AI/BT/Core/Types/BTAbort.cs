  // The Abort mechanism works in two ways:
  
  // Abort Self:
  // The current branch execution needs to be interrputed. For this, the Abort node Id is
  // cached into the Agent component
  // When that is activated, "Is Aborting" returns true. When it happens, the BT pipeline
  // reacts accordingly by not letting the execution continue until that node is reached
  // when bubbling up in the tree
  // Nodes start returning Abort and have their Status marked as Abort
  // Composite nodes then treats these Abort results the same as Failures, on the child completion callback

  // Abort Lower Priority:
  // The sibling nodes from the node that caused the Abort are marked with Status = Abort
  // This does NOT make "Is Aborting" return true. Meaning that the current execution is
  // not interrupted at all
  // Then, when a Composite tries to execute the lower priority nodes, those nodes
  // will result right away in Abort, not even entering those nodes
  // The Composites then use such info by considering it the same as a Failure
  // in the OnUpdate
